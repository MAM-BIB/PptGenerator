<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project  

If you have a collection of PowerPoint slides that you will reuse for different presentation, you can easily create o new presentation with the slides from your collection.  

Features: 
* You can create a new presentation without opening PowerPoint
* You can easily select multiple slides from your collection
* You can use placeholders that will be replaced by the program
* You can save presentations as a preset and load them up again to change them
* You can load pptx files created with this program similar to presets (presets have smaller file size)

<br />

__IMPORTANT__  
All slides need to have a `UID`  
A UID is written in the notes a presentation and looks like this:  
```sh
  UID:LTCyabi1keUKQEvQd7aKnQ
  ```
Since the UIDs are required and every slide from your collections needs to a unique one, the program will check the UIDs and tells if the UIDs are missing or if there a duplicated ones. You will then have the ability to change them manually or let the program do it for you.
